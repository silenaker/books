> 摘要:  
> An on–line algorithm is presented for constructing the suffix tree for a
> given string in time linear in the length of the string. The new algorithm has
> the desirable property of processing the string symbol by symbol from left to
> right. It has always the suffix tree for the scanned part of the string ready.
> The method is developed as a linear–time version of a very simple algorithm
> for (quadratic size) suffix tries. Regardless of its quadratic worst-case this
> latter algorithm can be a good practical method when the string is not too
> long. Another variation of this method is shown to give in a natural way the
> well–known algorithms for constructing suffix automata (DAWGs).
